

 The Circle class inherits the Cylinder class. When creating an object of Circle, the constructor of the Cylinder(superclass) is called

 inside the constructor of Circle. However, the constructor of Cylinder takes two arguments while the constructor of Circle take only one

 argument. Therefore, it generates an error when the constructor of Cylinder is called inside the Circle constructor with the only available

 one argument.
